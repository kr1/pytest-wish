Search all installed modules for functions that pass a given feature-specification test suite.
See the `package documentation`_ for the gory details.

Intended audience: python developers who've got better things to do than reinvent wheels.

.. warning:: Development status: **almost beta** (but not quite there yet).


Source code *search by tests* or *Test-Driven no-Development*
-------------------------------------------------------------

    "Have a look at this piece of code that I’m writing--I’m sure it has been written before.
    I wouldn't be surprised to find it verbatim somewhere on GitHub." - `@kr1`_

`pytest-wish`_ is a `pytest`_ plugin that enables a software development strategy called
*search by tests* or *Test-Driven no-Development*,
that is an extension of the *Test-Driven Development* paradigm.

The idea is that once the developer has written the tests that define the behaviour of a new
function to a degree sufficient to validate the implementation they are going to write
it is good enough to validate
any implementation. Running the tests on a large set of functions may result in a *hit*, that is
a function that already implements their feature.

Due to its nature the approach is better suited for discovering smaller functions
with a generic signature.


Installation
------------

You can install `the latest version of "pytest-wish"`_ via the ``pip`` package manager::

    $ pip install pytest-wish


First test run
--------------

Let's create a our first test file with the simple specification of the factorial function
using the ``wish`` fixture::

    # content of test_factoral.py
    def test_factorial(wish):
        factorial = wish
        assert factorial(0) == 1
        assert factorial(1) == 1
        assert factorial(21) == 51090942171709440000

That's it. You can now execute the test function on all functions in the Python standard library::

    $ py.test --wish-from-stdlib
    ======================= test session starts ==========================
    platform darwin -- Python 3.5.0, pytest-2.8.7, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1
    rootdir: /tmp, inifile: setup.cfg
    plugins: wish-0.9.0, timeout-1.0.0
    collected 3259 items

    test_factorial.py xxxxx[...]xxxxxXxxxxx[...]xxxxx

    ============================== 1 hit =================================

    test_factorial.py::test_factorial[math:factorial] HIT

    ==== 3258 xfailed, 1 xpassed, 27 pytest-warnings in 45.07 seconds ====

We just found that the ``factorial`` function in the ``math`` module is the only *HIT*,
that is it passes our specification test, and is the function we were looking for.


Usage
-----

The plugin adds the following options to pytest command line::

    wish:
      --wish-from-stdlib    Collects objects form the Python standard library.
      --wish-from-installed
                            Collects objects form all installed packages.
      --wish-from-all       Collects objects form the Python standard library and
                            all installed packages.
      --wish-from-specs=WISH_FROM_SPECS=[WISH_FROM_SPECS=...]
                            Collects objects from installed packages. Space
                            separated list of `pip` specs.
      --wish-from-modules=WISH_FROM_MODULES=[WISH_FROM_MODULES=...]
                            Collects objects from installed modules. Space
                            separated list of module names.
      --wish-includes=WISH_INCLUDES=[WISH_INCLUDES=...]
                            Space separated list of regexs matching full object
                            names to include, defaults to include all objects
                            collected via `--wish-from-*`.
      --wish-excludes=WISH_EXCLUDES=[WISH_EXCLUDES=...]
                            Space separated list of regexs matching full object
                            names to exclude, defaults to match 'internal use'
                            names '_|.*[.:]_'
      --wish-objects-from=WISH_OBJECTS_FROM
                            File name of full object names to include.
      --wish-predicate=WISH_PREDICATE
                            Full name of the predicate passed to
                            `inspect.getmembers`, defaults to `callable`.
      --wish-timeout=WISH_TIMEOUT
                            Test timeout.
      --wish-fail           Show wish failures.

Another example, find a function that decomposes a URL into individual rfc3986 components::

    $ py.test examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py --wish-from-modules urllib.parse
    [...]
    examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py::test_rfc3986_parse_basic[urllib.parse:urlparse] HIT
    examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py::test_rfc3986_parse_basic[urllib.parse:urlsplit] HIT
    [...]

the two functions ``urlparse`` and ``urlsplit`` pass the basic rfc3986 parsing test, but do not
pass the more complex ``test_rfc3986_parse_full`` test.

More advanced functions are available on PyPI::

    $ pip install urllib3
    $ py.test examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py --wish-from-modules urllib3
    [...]
    examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py::test_rfc3986_parse_basic[urllib3.util.url:parse_url] HIT
    examples/test_rfc3986_parse.py::test_rfc3986_parse_full[urllib3.util.url:parse_url] HIT
    [...]

now the function ``parse_url`` in the module ``urllib3.util.url`` passes both tests.
